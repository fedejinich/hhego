# hhego

hhego is a Go library specifically designed to implement hybrid homomorphic encryption schemes. This library merges the advantages of symmetric and homomorphic encryption methodologies, employing PASTA as the symmetric cipher and BFV as the homomorphic cipher. The outcome is a hybrid homomorphic encryption system that ensures secure computation on encrypted data while preserving the efficiency of symmetric encryption for large-scale processing tasks.

## Dependencies

This library depends on the following packages:

- [lattigo v4](https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo): A library for lattice-based multi-party homomorphic encryption in Go
